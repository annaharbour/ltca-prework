    "\n",
    "Welcome to Session 1! Today we will review some fundamental programming concepts from previous sessions and then dive into lists—one of the most versatile data structures in Python. We will see how lists can store different types of values, how to manipulate them, and finally, you'll practice what you've learned through a guided exercise.\n",

    "## Agenda\n",
    "1. **Review and Demo** (15 minutes): Recap previous material and run a couple of live demos.\n",
    "2. **New Information – Introducing Lists** (40–45 minutes): Learn how to create, access, modify, and check membership in lists using several examples with different data types.\n",
    "3. **We Do and Wrap Up** (30 minutes): A hands-on exercise to solidify your understanding of lists."
